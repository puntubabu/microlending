# Microlending

Allow stockists to approve buyers for microlending.


If buyer wants to resell items, but does not have the skills to produce items, stockists should loan items from producers (sellers)
to buyers. Then, buyers can locally sell their products at a market or any other community-based selling ground.
Risk will only be for stockists and buyers, but NOT producers. Producers can keep on producing and selling their goods without any further risk from
microlending.
